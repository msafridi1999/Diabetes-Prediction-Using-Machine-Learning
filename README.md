# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients by analyzing various medical data points using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in early detection of diabetes, enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes.

# Features
> Predictive Model: Uses machine learning to predict the probability of diabetes based on patient data.
> Feature Analysis: Considers factors like glucose levels, BMI, age, and family history in predictions.
> Model Evaluation: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to evaluate model performance.
> Streamlit Interface: A web-based user interface for easy input of patient data and viewing predictions.

# Technologies Used
> Python: Main programming language.
> Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.
> NumPy: Numerical operations.
> Scikit-Learn: Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
> Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.
> Google Colab: Development environment for running and testing the model.
> Streamlit: Deployment of the model as an interactive web application.

# Installation
1.Clone the repository:

bash
code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction

2.Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3.Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
1. Development in Google Colab:

> Open the provided notebook in Google Colab to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and train the model.
2. Model Training: Train the model using the provided script or Colab notebook:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
3. Deploy with Streamlit: Deploy the model as a web application using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
4.Make Predictions: Input patient data through the Streamlit interface to get predictions.

# Dataset
You can use a public dataset like the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset or your own data. The dataset should include features such as:

> Glucose levels
> Blood Pressure
> BMI
> Age
> Family History of Diabetes
> Insulin Levels
> Skin Thickness

# Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

> Accuracy
> Precision
> Recall
> F1-Score
> Confusion Matrix
These metrics help in assessing the effectiveness of the model in predicting diabetes.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvement or find any issues, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.
